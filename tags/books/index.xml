      <description>This is a great story about a young man who takes a summer job at a carny, leaves school, solves a crime with a ghost twist that only Stephen King can come up with. I loved it. Go pick it up at Amazon.com</description>

      <title>The Professional Thief</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book was written by researching and talking with a professional thief. The slang and mentality is from the 1900s. My initial thoughts were not very favorable when I was about 60 pages into the book. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see what information I could get out of the book that wanted covered in the movie/play Oliver or the more relevant BBC show hustle. I&amp;rsquo;m not one to put down a book I&amp;rsquo;ve set to read so I carried on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
